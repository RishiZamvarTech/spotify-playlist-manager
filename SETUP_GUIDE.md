## Step 3: Install and Run

The window will auto-close after 2 seconds.

## Daily Usage

### Starting the Server

Every time you want to use the app:

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/spotify-playlist-manager
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Stopping the Server

When you're done:

- Press `Ctrl + C`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot find module 'dotenv'"

**Solution:** Run `npm install` in the project directory.

### Problem: "Failed to load playlist"

**Solutions:**
1. Check that you've authorized at `/login`
2. Verify your credentials in `.env` are correct
3. Make sure you're logged in as media@wbru.com on Spotify

### Problem: Port 3000 is already in use

**Solution:** Change the port in `.env`:
```
PORT=3001
```

Then also update `REDIRECT_URI`:
```
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/callback
```

And update the Redirect URI in your Spotify app settings on the Developer Dashboard.

### Problem: "No authorization found" after restarting

**Check:** Look for the `.tokens.json` file in the project folder. If it's missing, you'll need to authorize again at `/login`.

If the file exists but you're still not authorized, delete it and re-authorize:
```bash
rm .tokens.json
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/login` again.

---

## Security Notes

- **Keep `.env` and `.tokens.json` secure**
- These files contain secrets and should stay on your local machine
- Never share these files with anyone
